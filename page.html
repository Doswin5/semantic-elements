      			I was introduced to the coding world when I was in 300L by a man named Mr. Ferdinard. He challenged us to profer a solution to the challenges the Health department in my university were facing as at that time which was improper documentation of students and staffs. We were grouped randomly to work on the challenge which I found very interesting and it has really been valuable in my Teamwork spirit in the Tech world at the moment.
